-------------------------------   Introduction   ------------------------------
Data set: Gapminder

For this assigment I used two sets of variables for univariate and bivariate analysis.
For the univariate analysis my variable is 'polityscore': 2009 Democracy score (Polity); Overall polity score from the Polity IV dataset, calculated by subtracting an autocracy score from a democracy score. The summary measure of a country's democratic and free nature. -10 is the lowest value, 10 the highest.
This variable is categorical as there is no way to measure one country's democratic score accurately.

For the bivariate analysis I used income per person and CO2 emissions. Note that the emissions are not per year but an aggregate in metric tons from 1751 until 2006.

Univariate analysis: polity score:

Standard Deviation:     6.31

----------------------   Interpretation Of The Results   ----------------------
We can see that for the univariate analysis the mean is around 3.7. This indicates that the countries are somewhat democratic (3.7 > 0). From the graph we can see that the distribution is not symmetric nor does it have any defined skewnewss. The distribution is multi modal with modes in -7; 0; 8 and 10. The median is 6 and this indicates again in favor of a 'democratic trend' because the greater the number of countries with a 10 score the higher the median should be (the same behavior for mean as well).
On the other hand a standard deviation of 6 in a total range of 21 values shows there there is a lot of spread in the data.

For the bivariate analysis we can intuitively see that the more higher income per person the higher are the CO2 emissions. A positive correlation exists between the two variables. However we can see that income per person is far from defining the CO2 emissions: consider for example countries with incomes around 40 000. There are 4 points of CO2 emissions ranging from 3.5e11 to near zero. The second highest point (China) also demonstrates that there are a lot of other variables involved. For its income per person ~ 2 500 there are a lot of other countries with much smaller CO2 emissions.
