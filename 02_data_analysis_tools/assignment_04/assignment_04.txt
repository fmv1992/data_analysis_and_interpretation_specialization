Instructions
The final assignment deals with testing a potential moderator. When testing a potential moderator, we are asking the question whether there is an association between two constructs for different subgroups within the sample.
Instructionsless 
Run an ANOVA, Chi-Square Test or correlation coefficient that includes a moderator.

WHAT TO SUBMIT:
Following completion of the steps described above, create a blog entry where you submit syntax used to test moderation (copied and pasted from your program) along with corresponding output and a few sentences of interpretation. 

Review Criterialess 
Your assessment will be based on the evidence you provide that you have completed all of the steps. In all cases, consider that the peer assessing your work is likely not an expert in the field you are analyzing.

Data set: National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).

Method: Chi-Square Test.

Research question: My theory is that people who are excelent at math and sciences have trouble getting along at school. I think this is mitigated if they are more of a polymath (that is they have aptitude with other disciplines).

Explanatory Variable: Doing great in Math and Sciences.

Response variable: Student is happy at school.

Moderator Variable: Doing great in Humanities.

Definition of the groups:
	- (categorical) Student is exceptional in math AND sciences, that is their grade in both disciplines are A
		value of 1 if True
		value of 0 if False
	- (categorical) Student is exceptional in Humanities, that is their grade in both disciplines are A
		value of 1 if True
		value of 0 if False
	- (categorical) Student is happy at school.
		value of 1 if True (either 'strongly agree' or 'agree')
		value of 0 if False ('neither agree nor disagree', 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree')

Variables:
H1ED11 - At the {MOST RECENT GRADING PERIOD/LAST GRADING PERIOD IN THE SPRING}, what was your grade in English or language arts?
H1ED12 - And what was your grade in mathematics?
H1ED13 - 3nd what was your grade in history or social studies?
H1ED14 - And what was your grade in science?
H1ED22 - (How much do you agree or disagree with the following:) [If SCHOOL YEAR:] You are happy to be at your school. [If SUMMER:] Last year, you were happy to be at your school.

----------------------   Interpretation Of The Results   ----------------------
We can see that the percentage of students that are happy at their schools is:
64.6%
For the students performing well at school in exact sciences the percentage is:
75.6%
If on top of that they perform well in human sciences the percentage is:
77.5%
If they perform well in exact sciences but not in human sciences the percentage is:
73.2%

We can conclude that there is a correlation between performing well in exact sciences and being happy at school (with p = 0.0000 < 0.05). On top of that my research question is: is performing well in human sciences a moderating variable? That is for the group of students who perform well on exact sciences, does performing well in human sciences changes the strenght and direction of being happy at school?

In this case there is no way of changing the direction of the variable since I only considered being happy at school or not being happy. To give a possible direction another categorical variable (being unhappy for example) would have to exist.

Therefore we are left with assessing the changing in the strenght of the explanatory variable and the response variable.

We can see that there is an increase from 75.6% for students performing well on exact sciences to 77.5% if the student also performs well in human sciences. There is also a decrease to 73.2% if the student does not perform well on human sciences.
