Data set: National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).

Method: Chi-Square Test.

Research question: My theory is that people who are excelent at math and sciences have trouble getting along at school. I think this is mitigated if they are more of a polymath (that is they have aptitude with other disciplines).

Explanatory Variable: Doing great in Math and Sciences.

Response variable: Student is happy at school.

Moderator Variable: Doing great in Humanities.

Definition of the groups:
	- (categorical) Student is exceptional in math AND sciences, that is their grade in both disciplines are A
		value of 1 if True
		value of 0 if False
	- (categorical) Student is exceptional in Humanities, that is their grade in both disciplines are A
		value of 1 if True
		value of 0 if False
	- (categorical) Student is happy at school.
		value of 1 if True (either 'strongly agree' or 'agree')
		value of 0 if False ('neither agree nor disagree', 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree')

Variables:
H1ED11 - At the {MOST RECENT GRADING PERIOD/LAST GRADING PERIOD IN THE SPRING}, what was your grade in English or language arts?
H1ED12 - And what was your grade in mathematics?
H1ED13 - 3nd what was your grade in history or social studies?
H1ED14 - And what was your grade in science?
H1ED22 - (How much do you agree or disagree with the following:) [If SCHOOL YEAR:] You are happy to be at your school. [If SUMMER:] Last year, you were happy to be at your school.

----------------------   Interpretation Of The Results   ----------------------
We can see that the percentage of students that are happy at their schools is:
64.6%
For the students performing well at school in exact sciences the percentage is:
75.6%
If on top of that they perform well in human sciences the percentage is:
77.5%
If they perform well in exact sciences but not in human sciences the percentage is:
73.2%

We can conclude that there is a correlation between performing well in exact sciences and being happy at school (with p = 0.0000 < 0.05). On top of that my research question is: is performing well in human sciences a moderating variable? That is: does performing well in human sciences changes the strenght and direction of the interaction between performing well on exact sciences and being happy at school?

In this case there is no way of changing the direction of the variable since I only considered being happy at school or not being happy. To give a possible direction another categorical variable (being unhappy for example) would have to exist or some degree of happiness would have to exist.

Therefore we are left with assessing the changing in the strenght of the explanatory variable and the response variable.

In the first moderated group the students perform great in human sciences. Changing their performance in exact sciences does not significantly changes their happiness at school (p = 0.24 > 0.05). 

In the second group the students do not perform great in human sciences. Changing their performance in exact sciences does alter their happiness at school (p = 0.0000 < 0.05).

We reject the hypothesis that for high performing students in human sciences there is a correlation between performing well in exact sciences and being happy at school.
We accept the hypothesis that for NOT high performing students in human sciences there is a correlation between performing well in exact sciences and being happy at school.

Therefore changing the performance in human sciences from great to not great changed the statistic significance of the high performing students in exact sciences happiness at school.
