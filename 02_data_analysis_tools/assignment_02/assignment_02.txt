The second assignment deals with the Chi-Square Test of Independence. A Chi-Square Test of Independence compares frequencies of one categorical variable for different values of a second categorical variable. The null hypothesis is that the relative proportions of one variable are independent of the second variable; in other words, the proportions of one variable are the same for different values of the second variable. The alternate hypothesis is that the relative proportions of one variable are associated with the second variable. Note that if your research question only includes quantitative variables, you can categorize those just to get some practice with the tool.
Review criterialess 

Run a Chi-Square Test of Independence.

You will need to analyze and interpret post hoc paired comparisons in instances where your original statistical test was significant, and you were examining more than two groups (i.e. more than two levels of a categorical, explanatory variable).

Note: although it is possible to run large Chi-Square tables (e.g. 5 x 5, 4 x 6, etc.), the test is really only interpretable when your response variable has only 2 levels (see Graphing decisions flow chart in Bivariate Graphing chapter).

WHAT TO SUBMIT:

Following completion of the steps described above, create a blog entry where you submit syntax used to run a Chi-Square Test (copied and pasted from your program) along with corresponding output and a few sentences of interpretation.

Data set: Mars Craters

After glancing at the distribution of craters in Mars I have noticed that they are unevenly distributed. A couple of sample plots from the entire data set gave me the impression that for longitudes around -150 deg and latitudes +50 deg there are less craters. This assignment goes on to check this.

Null hypothesis: there is no association between Mars' surface location and crater density.

Alternative hypothesis: there is an association between Mars' surface location and crater density.
-------------------------------   Code Section   ------------------------------
----------   Code Overview   ----------
First the code ilustrates my research question with a plot. A sample of 2000 craters is plotted against latitude and longitude. Notice the 'emptiness' around the (long=-150, lat=50) point.

Then the code proceeds to categorize latitude and longitude into 10 categories each. After that the code sorts the craters' database into those 100 regions.

I will only compare the crater in the region (lat=(50, 70], long=[-180,140]) with other latitudes otherwise the number of comparisons would be too large. The central region of long=(-20,+20] was chosen as the second parameter for longitude.

Summarizing: I noticed the 'emptiness' of region (lat=(50, 70], long=[-180,140]). I chose a latitude where I think the craters are more 'crowded' long=(-20,+20]. Then I iterated over all other latitude regions (from -90 to +90, excluding the selected/fixed region) and performed chi squared tests.

The print results are the following:

----------------------   Interpretation Of The Results   ----------------------
Null hypothesis: there is no association between Mars' surface location and crater density.

For all the tests p_observed < p_bonferoni_adjusted except for one. That means that for all these tests the null hypothesis should be rejected and we can affirm that for these pair of groups, under the considered longitudes regions, there is an association between location (latitude) and crater density.

For one test with latitude (-10, 10] the p_value is high (0.736) and for this pair of latitudes there is no association between location and crater density.

It is worth noting that for the region of latitude [-90, -70] p_observed is barely below p_bonferoni_adjusted:
0.005 < 0.006 
We can also notice that this region has a low density of craters and this gives strenght to the null hypothesis in this case since we are comparing two regions of low crater density.

WRONG: density is wrong because latitude and longitude chunks have different areas...
WRONG: YOUR CROSS TAB IS BETWEEN LAT AND LONG NOT ABOUT DENSITY
