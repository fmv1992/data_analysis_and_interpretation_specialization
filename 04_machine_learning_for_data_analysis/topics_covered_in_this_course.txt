About this Course

Are you interested in predicting future outcomes using your data? This course
helps you do just that! Machine learning is the process of developing,
testing, and applying predictive algorithms to achieve this goal. Make sure to
familiarize yourself with course 3 of this specialization before diving into
these machine learning concepts. Building on Course 3, which introduces
students to integral supervised machine learning concepts, this course will
provide an overview of many additional concepts, techniques, and algorithms in
machine learning, from basic classification to decision trees and clustering.
By completing this course, you will learn how to apply, test, and interpret
machine learning algorithms as alternative methods for addressing your
research questions.

[_] LESSON 01: What is ML?
	: Statistical methods including linear and logistic regressions
	: Can be used to:
	:	- Describe associations
	:	- Search for patterns
	:	- Make predictions
    [_] <<< WE TYPICALLY DO NOT USE ML TO DO HYPOTHESIS TESTING >>>
    [_] Training set -> test set
        : Obviously it fits the training set well but it might not fit the test
        : set so well
    [_] Test error rate
        : Goal: find a model that will minimize the test error rate.
	[_] Bias variance trade-off
		: Accuracy = mean squared error
		: Variance: change in parameter estimates across different data sets
		: Bias:
		: Ideal statistical model: low variance, low bias
			: Overfitted model: low bias; high variance; like a high deg polynomial
			: Underfitted model: high bias; low variance
	[_] Supervised prediction
		: A set of explanatory varibales -> response variable
		: Variables can appear more than once
	Decision Trees
		: When a data has a large number of expl. variables that interact in a complicated way.
		: A data mining method that allows us to explore the presencial of potentiall complicated interactions in data
		: Creates segmentation
		: Is a method of supervised prediction
