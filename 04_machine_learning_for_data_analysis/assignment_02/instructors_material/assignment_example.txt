Random forest analysis was performed to evaluate the importance of a series of
explanatory variables in predicting a binary, categorical response variable.
The following explanatory variables were included as possible contributors to
a random forest evaluating regular smoking (my response variable), age, gender,
(race/ethnicity) Hispanic, White, Black, Native American and Asian. Alcohol
use, marijuana use, cocaine use, inhalant use, availability of cigarettes in
the home, whether or not either parent was on public assistance, any experience
with being expelled from school, alcohol problems, deviance, violence,
depression, self-esteem, parental presence, parental activities, family
connectedness, school connectedness and grade point average.

The explanatory variables with the highest relative importance scores were
marijuana use, White ethnicity, deviance and grade point average. The accuracy
of the random forest was 78%, with the subsequent growing of multiple trees
rather than a single tree, adding little to the overall accuracy of the model,
and suggesting that interpretation of a single decision tree may be
appropriate.
