        Storm Events Database

        The Storm Events Database contains the records used to create the official NOAA Storm Data publication, documenting:

        * The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce;
        * Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and
        * Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.

        The database currently contains data from January 1950 to February 2017, as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). Due to changes in the data collection and processing procedures over time, there are unique periods of record available depending on the event type. NCEI has performed data reformatting and standardization of event types but has not changed any data values for locations, fatalities, injuries, damage, narratives and any other event specific information. Please refer to the Database Details page for more information.

    * *Coursera description*:

        The Storm Event Database contains extensive National Weather Service data on storm events by state and county. Storm events are recorded for hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, hail, floods, drought conditions, lightning, high winds, snow, temperature extremes, and other weather phenomena. The capstone data set includes detailed data on N=166,048 storm events that occurred between Jan, 2013 and October 2015. The Storm Event Data Codebook.pdf file includes a list of variables in the data set with brief descriptions of the variables. More extensive information on the variables and NWS database recording protocols can be found in NWS Storm Event Data Documentation.pdf.
