    * Project title:
        * Finding correlations between weather events and human/material losses
    * Few sentences to introduce the research question:
        * Using the 'National Weather Service' data set on weather events I'll
          find correlations between weather events (e.g. flash floods,
          tornados, etc) and human (deaths/injuries) and material losses
          (estimated in USD).  
          Additional information to be used:  
          Geographic information (latitude/longitude/state) will also be used
          to find meaningful relations.  
          Time series information will also be explored (dates between 2013 and
          \ 2015) to inspect if there is any correlation with season and/or time
          of the day.  
    * Motivation to answer the question:
        * The motivation to answer the question is to better understand the
          correlations of human/material losses with weather events.
    * How answer can help industry/field/society as a whole:
        * The answer could enable public authorities and weather institutes to
          better prepare themselves in the case of a harmful wather event and
          could possibly predict future events.  
    * Data:
        * **Storm Event Data**
