-------------------------------   Introduction   ------------------------------
This assignment deals with agriculture. The point is to use key explanatory variables which relates to agricultural potential (1), mechanization in agriculture (2) and modern techniques (3) to assess the productivity of agriculture.

During the database management though I found out that no values for the explanatory variable (2) were valid. All of them were missing. So I decided to take nature into account and changed it to 'Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)'. Again all values were missing. Finally I tried 'Arable land (% of land area)'.

Data set: World Bank, data from 2010.

Research Question: The impact of the explanatory variables in the response variable (see details below).

Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between the explanatory variable and the response variables.

Explanatory variables:
	1) Agricultural land (% of land area)
	2) Agricultural machinery, tractors per 100 sq. km of arable land*
	3) Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land)

* tried to change to 'Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)'; again all values were missing
  finally tried to change to 'Arable land (% of land area)' and was successful.

So the Explanatory variables in the end are:
	1) Agricultural land (% of land area)
	2) Arable land (% of land area)
	3) Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land)

Response variable:
	1) Agriculture value added per worker (constant 2005 US$) / Agricultural land (sq. km)

Notice that all the variables are relative to land area (with a slight variation for fertilizer consumption which is per hectare of arable land) except for the response variable which divides it by worker.

Description:

Cuts the database to contain only the following variables:

AG.LND.AGRI.ZS	Agricultural land (% of land area)	Agricultural land refers to the share of land area that is arable, under permanent crops, and under permanent pastures. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, including natural and cultivated crops.	Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.

AG.LND.TRAC.ZS	Agricultural machinery, tractors per 100 sq. km of arable land	Agricultural machinery refers to the number of wheel and crawler tractors (excluding garden tractors) in use in agriculture at the end of the calendar year specified or during the first quarter of the following year. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.	Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.
    replaced by
AG.LND.PRCP.MM	Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)	Average precipitation is the long-term average in depth (over space and time) of annual precipitation in the country. Precipitation is defined as any kind of water that falls from clouds as a liquid or a solid.	Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.
    replaced by
AG.LND.ARBL.ZS	Arable land (% of land area)	Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.	Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.

AG.CON.FERT.ZS	Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land)	Fertilizer consumption measures the quantity of plant nutrients used per unit of arable land. Fertilizer products cover nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers (including ground rock phosphate). Traditional nutrients--animal and plant manures--are not included. For the purpose of data dissemination, FAO has adopted the concept of a calendar year (January to December). Some countries compile fertilizer data on a calendar year basis, while others are on a split-year basis. Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.	Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.

EA.PRD.AGRI.KD	Agriculture value added per worker (constant 2005 US$)	Agriculture value added per worker is a measure of agricultural productivity. Value added in agriculture measures the output of the agricultural sector (ISIC divisions 1-5) less the value of intermediate inputs. Agriculture comprises value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Data are in constant 2005 U.S. dollars.	Derived from World Bank national accounts files and Food and Agriculture Organization, Production Yearbook and data files.

----------------------   Interpretation Of The Results   ----------------------
This is a long assignment. Let's divide it in parts:

PART 01: Summary and what was found in the regression analysis

	# p-values:
		For arable land and agricultural land the p values are greater than 0.05 and we conclude that there is no statistical significance of these two variables in the model. But they do not seem to be correlated as their r-value is aprox. zero (see 'checking for confounding' in code).
		The fertilizer consumption has a significant p value (p = 0.000 < 0.05) and a positive correlation with the response variable.

	# beta coefficient:
		The beta coefficients of the first two non significant variables is not significant. That is: there is a chance that it could be zero.
		For the significant variable there is a positive correlation with the response variable. That is, the greater the fertilizer consumption the greater the value added in agriculture per worker per area of land.

	# fitness of the model:
		The model as a whole is not strong to be used since two of the three variables are not significant in describing the response variable. The R-squared value of 0.17 shows that only 17% of the variability in the response variable can be explained the variability in the explanatory variables.

	# confounding:
		There is no evidence of confounding between the variables selected in this assignment (see above).

	# diagnostic plots:
	  ## qq plot
		In the qq-plot we can see that the distribution does not follow normality as there are some outlier in the -2.5 theoretical quantiles and 2.5 quantiles. This is further evidenced by the fact that the points do not follow the line.
	## standardized residuals
		For the 141 observations we can see that two of them lie outside the +- 4 standard deviation. The likelihood of that is almost null (smaller than 0.2%) and evidences that those points are in fact outliers. Most of the other points are near the mean.
	## levarege plot
		The plot indicates that Singapore (SGP) and Quatar (QAT) are the extreme/outlier points and that both have an uneven share in determining the fitness of the model.



Directions to assigment
<<<
 The blog entry should include
 		1) the summary of your results that addresses parts 1-4 of the assignment,
			1) what you found in your multiple regression analysis. Discuss the results for the associations between all of your explanatory variables and your response variable. Make sure to include statistical results (Beta coefficients and p-values) in your summary.
			2) Report whether your results supported your hypothesis for the association between your primary explanatory variable and the response variable.
			3) Discuss whether there was evidence of confounding for the association between your primary explanatory and response variable (Hint: adding additional explanatory variables to your model one at a time will make it easier to identify which of the variables are confounding variables); and
			4) generate the following regression diagnostic plots:
				a) q-q plot
				b) standardized residuals for all observations
				c) leverage plot
		2) the output from your multiple regression model, and
		3) the regression diagnostic plots.
